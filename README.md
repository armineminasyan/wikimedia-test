## Answers to a Data Analyst interview test

The original test was devised by the "Wikimedia Foundation Research and Data Analysis" and is available [here](https://github.com/wikimedia-research/Discovery-Hiring-Analyst-2016).
The original `README` is available as file `ORIGINAL-README.md`.

### Notebooks available

There are three notebooks available in this repo:
* `executive-summary.ipynb` is an executive summary conveying key insights from the data analysis.
* `data-scientist-summary.ipynb` is a slightly more verbose summary directed to fellow data scientists.
* `answers-and-code.ipynb` is the notebook used to analyse data and answer the questions from `ORIGINAL-README.md`.

### License
