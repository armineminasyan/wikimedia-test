The original test was devised by the "Wikimedia Foundation Research and Data Analysis" and is available [here](https://github.com/wikimedia-research/Discovery-Hiring-Analyst-2016).
The original `README` is available as file `ORIGINAL-README.md`.

In this repository, there are three Jupyter Notebooks using Python:
* [`executive-summary.ipynb`](https://github.com/armineminasyan/wikimedia-test/blob/master/executive-summary.ipynb) is an executive summary conveying key insights from the data analysis.
* [`data-scientist-summary.ipynb`](https://github.com/armineminasyan/wikimedia-test/blob/master/data-scientist-summary.ipynb) is a slightly more verbose summary directed to fellow data scientists.
* [`answers-and-code.ipynb`](https://github.com/armineminasyan/wikimedia-test/blob/master/answers-and-code.ipynb) is the notebook used to analyse data and answer the questions from `ORIGINAL-README.md`.
